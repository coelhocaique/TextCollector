Calum Ramm, a captain in the Marine Corps, has run many marathons in his day, but last week he set out on a far bigger challenge: running seven marathons on seven continents in just seven days as part of the World Marathon Challenge. Starting off deep in Antarctica on Jan. 23, he went on to complete marathons in Chile, Miami, Madrid, Morocco and Dubai before the finale in Sydney, Australia, on Friday. Only 15 athletes took part; those who finished ran 183.4 miles through snow, mountains, tropical heat and city streets.
Captain Ramm, from Lansing, Mich., is running to raise money for a charity, the Semper Fi Fund. and is a member of the official Marine Corps running team. Here are some of his thoughts about his experience:

Running in Antarctica was actually a lot easier than I thought. It was a four-lap course, and if I closed my eyes it was almost as if I was running in Michigan during a long winter in my high school days. I only had a base layer and jacket on, plus the normal hat / gloves / balaclava, and still overheated at times. Because the sky was the same hue as the snow, it was difficult to see anything more than white — and beyond it, the outline of mountains. A thin slice of blue sky off the horizon was the only thing that kept me from losing all orientation.
Chile was way easier, but the wind was brutal. Almost had me moving backwards at some points. I went out really slow, but dropped some serious splits on the last eight miles. Felt really good upon finishing, almost better than Antarctica. The footing was obviously better so that helped.
Last week I was at the wedding of an old co-worker. There was a big cast there, all past employees (physical and occupational therapists) from the amputee section of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Included in the mix was a former patient I recognized immediately, though I did not remember his injuries. That I remembered his face, but not the fact that he was missing both arms and a leg at the groin, caught me totally off guard.
Finding myself surprised by the extent of this young man’s injuries — injuries that were routine for so many years — well, a light flickered in my brain. And suddenly, I was back there in our old clinic, surrounded by young men on treatment tables. In my mind, their faces blurred softly and their injuries faded into the ever-present background of yellow hospital gowns, wheelchairs, and parallel bars.
At Walter Reed, where most of our patients were combat-injured active duty soldiers and marines — young men in their 20s with crew cuts — the therapists had gotten into the habit of identifying our patients by their injuries when discussing our caseload. Rob from Arkansas was a double AK (missing both legs above the knee) with orange running shoes. Charlie was a triple (missing three limbs) with a nonregulation beard that needed to come off STAT. Chris was an AK/BK (above knee and below knee amputee) who comes to PT in the morning and was really particular about time management (i.e., demanded to be seen at 0645 (6:45 a.m.) even though we didn’t start patient care until 0700.
Our patients did the same thing to each other. Referring to a soldier as a “hip” if he happened to missing a leg at the groin. Or jokingly, “paper cut” if a soldier was “only” missing one leg below the knee — all in spite of the fact that losing a limb is never a minor injury.
After several years in the amputee section, it was not unusual for my colleagues and me to request a favorite type of injury when we were asked to pick up a new patient. Darcy loved the challenge of working with double AK’s (missing legs above the knee). A devastating injury, but Darcy really had a flair for it. She scoffed off any compliments by saying it was only because they “couldn’t cheat” the way someone with a less severe amputation on the other side might.
Fourteen years ago, when I was a midshipman at Marine Corps Officer Candidates School, our female sergeant instructor lined us up at attention. “If you’re a woman in the Marine Corps,” she said, “you’re either a bitch, a dyke, or a ho.” Shocking? Perhaps. But with a purpose: she was trying to prepare us to interact with men who wouldn’t always be supportive of our presence. So this fall, before Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter announced that women would be allowed into all military occupations, I looked to the Marine Corps’ yearlong experiment to integrate women into ground combat jobs to see if attitudes had changed.
The early indications were not good. A four-page, unsigned summary of the experiment made public last summer bluntly concluded that all-male units outperformed integrated units in combat tasks, particularly hiking while carrying heavy loads and manning certain heavier weapons. But those four pages did not mention statistics about unit cohesion. When I interviewed several female Marines who participated in the experiment, I found an interesting pattern. The quality of leadership at the squad, platoon and company level was a key factor that directly affected the successful integration of women into a cohesive unit.
Sgt. Danielle Beck paused her career as a comptroller to join the experiment’s Weapons Company. She trained in anti-armor missiles, the heaviest of which weighed about sixty pounds. Of the six women that started in her platoon, she and two others finished; the other three were injured. “We had great leadership at Weapons Company,” Sergeant Beck said. The attitude was, ‘we’re here for a mission, we’re here for a task, and we’re gonna get this done.’ ”
Crucial to maintaining this attitude, she said, was the company leadership, headed by Capt. Mark Lenzi. “We interacted on a daily basis. We hiked, trained, P.T.’d — they were with us,” Sergeant Beck said. Leadership by example ingrained expectations of high performance into the troops.
Another advantage was that Weapons Company comprised mostly corporals and sergeants — NCOs in their early-to-mid-twenties, who were more mature than typical junior enlisted just out of high school. The men had been doing their jobs for years — tasks the women in the company had been trained for just months prior.
On December 2, 1941, an Army private named Harold Grove Moss was a week away from finishing his Morse Code training to become a radio operator. He was stationed at Camp Roberts in California. “Something seemingly a little unusual happened yesterday and that was all the Japanese boys were taken out of our battery,” he wrote that day in a letter to his parents in Minatare, Neb. But he didn’t dwell on it; he also mentioned that a homemade cake they sent “wasn’t broken a bit,” and ended with a modest Christmas list, including “a camera” and a “pair of brown civilian shoes (no two tone).” Five days later, as news of the attack on Pearl Harbor was filtering through the ranks, he wrote again.
“Dear folks,” he began,
“…Have just heard a few minutes ago that Japan has really declared war now and that we will retaliate immediately…All that goes with this war fervor is taking place all along the coast with patrols, listening posts, and ship movement orders being given…I hope, but I know it is a vain hope, that you will not worry unnecessarily and not be overly anxious about me.  Of course I will write often to tell you all I can, not knowing what will be done with the mail.”
Much of his mail did reach its destination, and is now available to many more readers thanks to his daughter, Lori Neumann, who has transcribed and posted this and 340 more of his letters from the Pacific at mossletters.com. Alongside the letters are dozens of photos and other bits of wartime ephemera which made it back to the states — some in the letters, and some with Mr. Moss himself. He began his tour as a University of Nebraska sophomore in September 1941 and saw action in the Philippines and in Okinawa as a member of the 225th Field Artillery Battalion; his service ended Nov. 1, 1945, a few months after the Japanese surrendered.
The first Democratic presidential debate once again raised the issue of military service during the Vietnam War. Senator Bernie Sanders was asked how he could be commander-in-chief, given that he applied for conscientious objector status during that war. (Though his application was rejected he was not drafted and did not serve.)
But while Mr. Sanders’s college-age pacifism — his office says he is not a pacifist now — has raised questions, he is not the only candidate to avoid Vietnam: Donald Trump and a few other candidates also were old enough to serve in that war but did not, for various reasons. The one candidate who did serve in Vietnam, former Senator Jim Webb, a decorated former Marine, dropped out of the Democratic nominating race. And the only remaining veteran in the pack, Senator Lindsey Graham, who recently retired from the Air Force Reserve, was 19 when the last American troops left Vietnam.
Vietnam has always been a sort of litmus test for some voters who view a lack of military service in that war as a cause for dismay and even disdain. But should the candidates be judged so harshly?
Most of us who were old enough to have been subject to the military draft during Vietnam view questions related to the war and our draft status through our personal reactions to that war. I signed up for a Marine Corps officer training program on Oct. 21, 1965, and my thoughts after the Democratic debate have focused on my situation around that time period: What was I thinking?
As a 20-year-old growing up in Lubbock, Tex., I had few philosophical thoughts about the war. A senior in high school at the time of the Cuban missile crisis in October 1962, I was keenly aware of the fear that communism might spread throughout the world, and I readily bought into the so-called domino theory that if South Vietnam fell to communist forces, other countries in the region would be next.
Since coming back from Afghanistan in 2008, the hard-hit Second Battalion, Seventh Marine Regiment has struggled to adjust. The battalion, known as the 2/7, lost 20 men in war. In the years since, it has lost 13 more to suicide. The battalion now has a suicide rate 14 times that for all Americans.
The New York Times asked Dr. Charles Engel, of the RAND Corporation, and two Marines who served with the battalion in Afghanistan, Arthur Karell and Keith Branch, to answer readers’ questions about the devastating effects of combat and the high suicide rate among veterans. The conversation took place on Facebook in October, moderated by Dave Philipps, a reporter for The Times who covers veterans’ affairs. Here are some of the questions and answers, which have been condensed and edited.
Q. Why were the mental health concerns of the battalion not identified following deployment? What can be done to better identify service members who are struggling?
Arthur Karell: The process for identifying mental health concerns consisted of one post-deployment health assessment (a questionnaire), along with two weeks of downtime leave after getting back to the States. Then the battalion immediately enters a training cycle for the next deployment. The overwhelming emphasis is on constant tactical training — longer-term considerations got crowded out. I have heard that this is now starting to change, and I hope that is actually the case. Allowing Marines and other service members more time to spend together as a cohesive unit after a combat deployment would go a long way to better identifying service members who are struggling. Finally, that there is zero information-sharing between the Department of Defense and the Veterans Administration makes it impossible for health providers or volunteer organizations to have access to information that could provide indications of possible problems. Privacy is an issue, but service members should at least have the option to allow their D.O.D. service records to inform V.A. health providers.
Keith Branch: Ideally, if someone scored as “high risk” on the post-deployment assessment, he or she would be referred to on-base mental health services. From my memory, there were only a handful of service members who utilized these services — I was one of them. However, my stint in therapy lasted less than a month. First, there is an extremely prevalent negative stigma associated with seeking mental health services, especially in the combat arms occupations where weakness is not tolerated. I hope things have changed since 2009. Second, the mental health services on base had long waiting periods and the solution was to prescribe medication. I know more than a few Marines who became addicts while seeking mental health services. From my experience, many Marines do not show signs of mental health problems until they separate from the service. I think being surrounded by the people who served in combat with you provides a sense of security. However, that security is lost when service members separate and return home.
As suicide attempts go, mine was of the halfhearted variety. In fact, some might even argue that it was no attempt at all. The police arrived at my Austin home following a fight I’d had in the driveway with my friend Bill, who’s also a veteran. Bill had been called over to the house by my then girlfriend because she was worried about the way I was acting.
I was wired on a cocktail of Adderall and Trazodone, and had a few drinks the night before as well. When the police arrived the following morning, a man and a woman, I asked the woman if her pistol was loaded.
“Of course it is. Why would you ask a thing like that?”
“Because I want you to shoot me in the head.”
To this day, I’m not sure why I said that. In retrospect I think it was less about wanting to die and more about expressing to another human being that I was in pain. But they were police officers, and a solicitation for suicide-by-cop, however unconvincing, was something they took very seriously.
“Right,” the male officer interjected. “We’re gonna have to bring you to the hospital.”
A minor struggle ensued outside, to the entertainment of my neighbors who observed the scene from a comfortable distance. I learned later from Bill and my now ex-girlfriend that the police entered my home and grabbed all the pharmacy bottles they could find (which numbered in the teens) and brought them to the hospital so the emergency room staff would know what I was on. They even stuck a catheter up my urethra.
They held me in observation for a day and a half, until I could get a friend to pick me up and drive me to the Austin Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic to speak to a mental health specialist. She wanted me to come in every week through the summer, but I told her I had plans to study abroad in France, so she made me promise to check back in when I returned or she would have me brought in. I came for a follow-up at the end of the summer, just because I didn’t want the police to come back to my house. I had no interest in engaging with the V.A. mental health specialists. They were way too quick to prescribe medication, and drugs were something I was trying to get away from.
A month before I started my freshman year of high school, my father was killed in a cycling accident. Overnight my mother became a single parent and our sole breadwinner. She was forced to work twelve-hour days to maintain our standard of living and consequently I was often alone in an empty house.
Like most teenagers, I rebelled. With the loss of my father came a profound loss of discipline in my life. Combined with the sudden absence of my mother who was now compelled to work long hours, the tragedy had an important tertiary effect: I stopped attending classes. Eventually, to the distress of my mother, I left high school, opting to take the G.E.D. instead. College was the last thing on my mind, because college was for savvy, affluent students who studied for SATs and graduated on a normal schedule. It wasn’t for people like me.
At 17, I would have been the ideal candidate for an ‘absentee father’ case study: misguided anger, unabashed recklessness, unclear identity. I sought challenges but had no purpose. Luckily (or unluckily) for me there was a war.
I was an Army recruiter’s dream. With my mother’s anxious signature, I was in.
Throughout most of my seven years in the military I gave little thought to the outside world. When provided the discipline, direction, and the brutish encouragement of male authority figures, I began to excel, rapidly advancing through the ranks. I was given ever-greater responsibility — making sergeant in two years. After my first three-year contract expired I enthusiastically re-enlisted for another four.
I had found my identity. I was a soldier.
Five years later everything changed during a deployment to Afghanistan in 2010.
One of our missions was to facilitate the opening of schools in Kunduz Province. That April, in an effort to intimidate girls from attending, the Taliban attacked the schools with poison gas. It didn’t work. The girls continued to walk to class despite the threat.
As a teenager, I had taken for granted the opportunity to have an education not because an armed insurgency prevented me, but because of my own ambivalence. In Afghanistan, a country plagued with incessant violence, the decision to go to school was often one of life or death. For me, it was a luxury I had wasted. And I regretted it.
Two women have now earned the Army’s elite Ranger designation. A third is in the final phase of Ranger School, the humidity-soaked “swamp phase” that ends later this month.
In the wake of this history making, Ranger School is now officially opened to women. And now Navy leaders say they are on track to open their arduous basic underwater demolition/SEAL training course to “anybody who can meet the gender non-specific standards” early next year.
Yet in this case the schoolhouse lags behind the battlefield. Women have served, taken fire and sacrificed their lives alongside the Army Rangers of the 75th Ranger Regiment for years.
I had no idea of this fact when, in 2012, a Marine told me about First Lt. Ashley White and her band of teammates who had been recruited for Ranger and SEAL combat missions a year earlier. They were part of what would come to be called cultural support teams, or C.S.T.s, a benign name for a groundbreaking concept.
“What about the combat ban?” I asked, full of disbelief since I had not heard about this story despite having reported from Afghanistan for years.
Her response was the equivalent of my mother-in-law’s frequently issued “bless her heart,” a verbal pat on the head offered to those clueless souls  lacking in awareness of just how much they do not know.
“Just check it out; you’ll see,” she said.
I did. And with each interview I finished, I realized that I had stumbled across a community of women recruited to “become part of history” and to join combat operations back in 2011, first by the United States Special Operations Command and then by the Army Special Operations Command. All while the combat ban remained very much in place. These soldiers and service members (not all were Army) could be there, legally, despite the ban on women in ground combat because they were “attached” to special operations teams, just not “assigned” to them.
The recent success of two female officers, both West Point graduates, in passing the Army’s grueling Ranger School has bolstered arguments for the full integration of women into the military’s front-line combat units. In becoming the first women to receive the coveted Ranger tab, the two officers proved that women can handle not just the physical challenges but also the psychological and leadership tests posed by the nine-week course.
Their graduation could not have come at a more important moment: In September, the heads of each armed services branch must tell Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter which positions and units they believe they can integrate and provide evidence for why any other position should remain closed.
As that deadline looms, the Marine Corps is dealing with its own gender-related controversy. In June, Lt. Col. Kate Germano was removed from her position as commander of the Fourth Battalion at Parris Island, the Marines’ all-female boot camp. During her time as commander, Colonel Germano asserted that the Marines’ setting lower standards for women than men led to an underlying sexism in the ranks, one that systematically kept women from reaching their full potential.
It is noteworthy that most of the reports and commentary about Colonel Germano’s case have been written by men. Some pieces have been sympathetic to her situation, including one by Elliot Ackerman, a former Marine Corps officer, who used her case to give an honest and objective look at the systemic problems acting as barriers for women in the Marines. He argued that an institutionalized “hyper-masculinity” is a greater barrier than physical standards to the full integration of women into all military positions. It is a point that needs deeper discussion.
To add breadth and depth to this conversation, and to take it beyond Colonel Germano’s case, I believe it is time to speak out about my experiences. The more women who are willing to speak about the way in which the ingrained hyper-masculinity hinders progress toward integrated forces, the closer we will come to an honest conversation about the true hurdles to gender integration.
Wars often produce iconic images that capture the naked truths of the struggle. Five Marines raise the American flag at Iwo Jima. A South Vietnamese general calmly fires a pistol into the head of a suspected Vietcong militant during the Tet offensive. A Huey evacuates Americans from a roof in Saigon in the spring of 1975.
One image from our experience in the United States Army during the Iraq war stands out. It is a photograph of our squadron commander, then Lt. Col. Rod Coffey, holding a captured flag. The flag is now the widely known black banner of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL. The photograph was taken by one of Colonel Coffey’s soldiers in March 2008 after American forces completely defeated insurgents in a portion of Diyala Province. Colonel Coffey stands with the flag in his right hand, his trademark cigar dangling in his left and the look of a man resolved to defeat militants whose barbarism today is ever so disturbingly documented by the media.
The flag is not unique to the Islamic State. Variations of the black banner adorned with the declaration of faith known as the shahada are used by other Islamic extremists. However, there is little doubt in our minds that the enemy our unit fought and defeated that winter would eventually become part of the Islamic State. Our unit found the flag near a mass grave site and an insurgent training camp.
Our unit — Third Squadron, Second Stryker Cavalry Regiment — then spent several days assisting Iraqi families in properly burying their dead. This was one of the many actions Colonel Coffey and our unit embraced to build trust with the Iraqis who had previously lived under the tyranny of the militant Islamists. Once sufficiently powerful American forces were in place to allow the people of Iraq to defy the extremists, Colonel Coffey worked closely with the senior sheikhs and political leaders to maintain the peace. He often told his men that the greatest weapon they wielded in the fight was decency.
Earlier this week, The Times asked readers what they thought of Lt. Col. Kate Germano’s article arguing parity for men and women who enlist in the Marines Corps, and what could be done to improve gender integration. Colonel Germano, who served at the all-women boot camp in Parris Island in South Carolina, wrote that women face “lower expectations for accountability” and that “high standards should be demanded of all recruits and Marines.”
About 350 people responded, most of them in favor of equal standards and expectations of training for Marines, but others believed that women cannot meet the physical demands required of a Marine when placed in conflict. Here are selections from the comments, which have been edited and condensed for clarity.
I graduated from Parris Island in 1976 and was one of the first female Marines allowed into the Avionics MOS. Though I was only one of two females in the entire squadron, I not only pulled my weight, but felt I made great strides for the female Marines to come behind me. I’m glad to see that nearly 40 years later, someone else is carrying that banner!
—Sarge56, Texas
I am a 1986 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point and have trained with women throughout my military career. They took the same classes and tests, and were expected to score as well or better than us, their male counterparts. There were a a few rare exceptions to the absolute meritocracy, all involving the upper body strength in specific physical strength tests. No bias, just a simple fact. I was privileged to study with and train alongside women who were every bit as capable and had the scores to prove it. I concur with Lt. Col Germano, lowering expectations lowers performance.
—Nelson, SLC, Utah
For decades the Marine Corps has tolerated, even encouraged, lower performance from the young women who enlist in its ranks, an insidious gender bias that begins with the way women are treated immediately after they sign up and continues through their training at boot camp. The results are predictable – female Marines risk being less confident and less fully accepted than their male counterparts, because the Corps has failed them from the outset.
That is the position of Lt. Col. Kate Germano, an active-duty Marine officer who commanded both a Marine recruiting station in San Diego and a segregated all-female training battalion at Parris Island, the Corps’ boot camp in South Carolina. Colonel Germano presented this argument in a draft article, “When Did It Become an Insult to Train Like a Girl?” that she wrote early this year and in which she argued for tougher standards and higher expectations, or, in her words, a movement toward “radical change.”
The article, which does not address full integration into combat roles but details institutional patterns that Colonel Germano suggests ensure female Marines will not be fully respected by their male peers, had been slated for publication in September in the monthly Marine Corps Gazette, a private publication that serves as the Corps’ de facto professional journal. Then matters grew complicated.
Colonel Germano was relieved of command at Parris Island in June under circumstances that remain contentious, setting off a controversy about whether she was being punished for what the Corps calls an abusive leadership style, or for forcefully expressing her views about the how the Corps trains and integrates women into its male-dominated ranks.
Soon after she was relieved, the editor of the Gazette, John Keenan, who is also a former Marine colonel, dropped Colonel Germano’s article from the journal’s publication lineup. Her arguments taking the Corps to task for what she depicted as a record of double standards and complacency stood not to reach Marines’ eyes, including such passages as this:
We step off the C-130 ramp from 13,000 feet above the Florida Keys and into a radiant, cool blue sky, cloudless yet hazy on the horizon. Arms interlocked, Dan, Paul and I skydive in a three-man formation while a fourth chases us with his helmet-cam. There is nothing inherently unique about the act of falling at 149 miles per hour, not after you’ve done it enough. But this jump has a sacramental feel even at terminal velocity, and I know it’s due to the name of the drop zone beneath us.
I’m not sure when the military started naming parachute drop zones for the fallen. But among Air Force pararescuemen and combat rescue officers like Dan, Paul and me, it’s standard practice to name drop zones for fallen brothers. Cunningham Drop Zone: named for Jason Cunningham, a pararescueman, or PJ, who died on Roberts Ridge during Operation Anaconda in 2002. Maltz Drop Zone: named for a PJ killed in a 2003 Afghanistan helicopter crash. Plite. Gentz, the first combat rescue officer, or CRO, to die in Afghanistan. Flores. The list goes on.
Dan emailed me a few months back and said it was time to do the same. Not for a PJ or CRO, but a Marine we had carried in our arms: Lt. Col. Christopher K. Raible. The commander of a deployed squadron of Harriers, Colonel Raible died defending his men from 15 heavily armed insurgents who slipped inside the perimeter of Camp Bastion, Afghanistan, on Sept. 14, 2012. Dan, Paul, and I were all there that night – but at the end of the night, it was Dan who escorted Colonel Raible’s flag-covered remains from the Harrier Squadron to the hospital. Dan’s goodbye salute was the first of many to come during the colonel’s long journey home.
•
At 6,000 feet, the three of us break apart and track across the sky away from one another before deploying our parachutes. It’s not until my chute is open, and I’m suspended a half-mile above the blue-green waters of Dry Tortugas National Park that I can actually appreciate the view. To the east five kilometers is Fort Jefferson – a Civil War era fortress whose dark battlements took 30 years to build. Beneath me, Loggerhead Island looks like an elongated skateboard. A narrow beach rings the 1.5 mile perimeter of the island, holding back fields of green that consist mainly of prickly pear cactus.

Brooklyn Museum’s new director, Anne Pasternak, has wasted no time in putting her mark on the presentation of the institution’s permanent collection. Under her auspices, an important section of the Egyptian galleries has been visually streamlined and the European paintings collection organized by theme. More important, the American collection has been made emphatically Pan-American, and true histories, many of them not beautiful, have begun to be told. This museum has always had the potential to be New York City’s great alternative encyclopedic space, the un-Met.

Returning in a production that played last year, Everett Quinton is in his old Ridiculous Theatrical Company glory days as a repressed Florida spinster in this farcical thriller, with tons of TV and old-movie melodrama, silly double entendres and a Cuban hunk named Ricardo (1:30).

Probably you’ve seen streamlined, amped-up productions of Shakespeare before, but the gimmick here is that as the performance of “Macbeth” begins, one of the actors downs a mind-fogging number of shots. What follows is a wild mash-up of Shakespeare and pop-culture references that seems chaotically improvised but takes a deceptive amount of skill to execute.

This timely new production of the much-loved and much-revived 1964 musical comedy honors the show’s ebullience of spirit, as embodied in the Jewish milkman Tevye (an assured and affecting Danny Burstein), living in a Russian shtetl in the early 20th century.

Early in the 1960s, Robert Irwin banned people from photographing his art. Self-identified as a painter at the time, he was in the process of refining his work to the point that it was accessible only through direct experience. To see it at all, you had to be there. In a way, he was proposing a new kind of “action painting.” The action in his version was generated not by the hand of the artist but by the mind and eye of the viewer, approaching art, taking it in, and reacting to it in real time.

Stephen Karam’s extraordinary comedy-drama — the finest of the season — has transferred to Broadway with its prized virtues intact: a superlative cast;  direction from Joe Mantello that deftly navigates its shifts in tone; and, of course, Mr. Karam’s delicate but trenchant writing, depicting with great humor and empathy a middle-class family on the edge of the abyss (1:35).

International Center of Photography

The International Center of Photography is back, and welcome. Two years after losing its Midtown quarters, the center has reopened on the Bowery, across from the New Museum. The duplex galleries are larger than the old ones, though they feel boxy and closed-in, at least for this inaugural offering. As if to offset the impression, the show gives evidence that the center’s embrace of photography itself has fully extended to digital media.

Working primarily in South America, Roberto Burle Marx, the great Brazilian landscape architect, designed some of the modern world’s most distinctive parks and gardens, from an immense, jazzy tattoo of a promenade on the beachfront of Rio de Janeiro to rooftop plantings in Brasília, a city carved from jungle. In the process, he became invested, heart and mind, in preserving the Amazonian paradise that surrounded him, fought to halt its devastation and turned his home near Rio into a sanctuary for one of the largest collections of tropical plants anywhere.

This show of 100 or so early photographs by Arbus (1923-71), many on view for the first time, has a terrific installation, with work hung on columnlike panels that suggest rows of doors receding into darkness. The pictures themselves, dating between 1956 and 1962, have a grainy, moody texture, and they reveal an Arbus who had already landed on some of her favored themes: childhood, negotiable gender, fringe culture and class. If the show as a whole is more powerful than most of its individual images, there are some wonderful things.

The Flyers’ Pierre-Eduoard Bellemare will play for France as it seeks one of three final berths.
Thanks to a scheduling change, players like the Flyers’ Pierre-Eduoard Bellemare, a Frenchman, can play for their countries in final qualifying tournaments.
The former Harvard forward signed a two-year contract with the Rangers, four years after the Nashville Predators selected him in the third round of the N.H.L. draft.
Jagr, who has more regular-season points against the Islanders than any other player, leads the Panthers in scoring.
A season ago, the Islanders were 26th in the N.H.L. in killing penalties; this season, they were fourth.
Though some initially blanched at the cost, U.S.A. Hockey’s concerted effort to develop talent has paid big dividends.
After 22 years and eight teams, the Panthers’ Jagr is bound for another playoff appearance and seems unlikely to retire any time soon.
Only one member of the 1990 N.H.L. Draft Class is still playing: Jaromir Jagr, who remains as much a marvel at 44 as he was 26 years ago, at 18. Here’s a look at every player from that draft:
The points scored by league leaders reflect how far removed hockey is from its offensive heyday, when Gretzky roamed the ice.

Caroline Garcia during a match Tuesday.
Here’s what’s happening, and what’s going to happen, at the United States Open on Friday.
The Argentine, who won the United States Open in 2009, enjoyed the support of the crowd as he became the only wild-card entrant to reach the third round in singles.
Andy Murray and the Williams sisters were among the players who advanced at a sealed stadium, despite the loud sound of pelting rain.
When a match isn’t going his way, a tortured-looking Murray may seek sympathy. He won’t find any from Ivan Lendl, his coach, a model of stoicism.
A single shout — or the Spidercam — can throw Murray off more than the steady din inside Arthur Ashe Stadium at the United States Open does.
Jared Donaldson, 19, who spent over two years in Buenos Aires learning the fine art of topspin, pulled off another U.S. Open upset on Thursday, against No. 32 Viktor Troicki.
Nadal, a two-time United States Open champion, has looked strong since pushing himself to come back from a wrist injury to play at the Rio Olympics.
Three young French players seeded at the United States Open — Benoit Paire, Kristina Mladenovic and Caroline Garcia — have all been provisionally suspended by the French tennis federation.
Bellis defeated a fellow American, Shelby Rogers, 2-6, 6-2, 6-2, and will next play second-seeded Angelique Kerber.
The retractable roof over Arthur Ashe Stadium was closed during a match for the first time as rain started falling while Rafael Nadal and Andreas Seppi were playing.
Roberta Vinci, in the role of spoiler, catapulted her way into a spot in last year’s United States Open final, but such breakout runs can be hard to repeat.
The junior world tennis rankings feature several successful Canadians, and Eugenie Bouchard and Milos Raonic have broken ground by reaching the Wimbledon final.
The continent has skilled players, but a lack of resources and opportunities, including access to top competition, keeps them from breaking through.
Saketh Myneni of India made five attempts at getting through Grand Slam qualifying draws before winning a spot at this year’s United States Open.
Replacing guesswork and opinion with reliable patterns and percentages can lead to a better understanding of the game, as well as improved play.
At 36, Venus Williams is balancing a still-vibrant tennis career and her athletic-wear and interior design businesses.
Ending the dominance of Djokovic, Federer, Nadal and Murray requires mental adjustments by the rank and file, says Carlos Moyá, who coaches No. 6 Milos Raonic.
He might be the most entertaining tennis player since John McEnroe. Too bad he’d rather be playing basketball.
Tennis is, of course, the main attraction at the U.S. Open, but hotel packages and restaurant specials and a kids’ day can be part of the experience.

Brooklyn Museum’s new director, Anne Pasternak, has wasted no time in putting her mark on the presentation of the institution’s permanent collection.

Early in the 1960s, Robert Irwin banned people from photographing his art. Self-identified as a painter at the time, he was in the process of refining his work to the point that it was accessible only through direct experience. To see it at all, you had to be there. In a way, he was proposing a new kind of “action painting.” The action in his version was generated not by the hand of the artist but by the mind and eye of the viewer, approaching art, taking it in, and reacting to it in real time.

The International Center of Photography is back, and welcome. Two years after losing its Midtown quarters, the center has reopened on the Bowery, across from the New Museum.

Working primarily in South America, Roberto Burle Marx, the great Brazilian landscape architect, designed some of the modern world’s most distinctive parks and gardens, from an immense, jazzy tattoo of a promenade on the beachfront of Rio de Janeiro to rooftop plantings in Brasília, a city carved from jungle. In the process, he became invested, heart and mind, in preserving the Amazonian paradise that surrounded him, fought to halt its devastation and turned his home near Rio into a sanctuary for one of the largest collections of tropical plants anywhere.

Met Breuer

This show of 100 or so early photographs by Arbus (1923-71), many on view for the first time, has a terrific installation, with work hung on columnlike panels that suggest rows of doors receding into darkness. The pictures themselves, dating between 1956 and 1962, have a grainy, moody texture, and they reveal an Arbus who had already landed on some of her favored themes: childhood, negotiable gender, fringe culture and class. If the show as a whole is more powerful than most of its individual images, there are some wonderful things.

Beejhy Barhany, the chef, was born in northern Ethiopia into a community of Beta Israel, as Ethiopian Jews are known. Her menu can read like a biography: eggs scrambled with lox over injera, the sour, springy Ethiopian flatbread perforated like coral; challah French toast spiked with awaze, a meld of earthy-hot berbere and tej, Ethiopian honey wine.

An outpost of an acclaimed Philadelphia hummus counter, Dizengoff offers pita straight out of the oven, swollen and chewy at the edges with pocks of scorch, and hummus made every hour and a half.

At this 85-square-foot falafel shop steps from the 96th Street subway station, Waled Haredy, a native of Egypt, offers gyro at street-cart prices and makes falafel to order from his mother’s recipe, which belonged to her mother and her grandmother before her.

This stand run by three brothers with roots in Cochabamba, Bolivia, specializes in salteñas, which must not be mistaken for empanadas. The dough is sweet and thick, as chewy as an underbaked cookie, and it is filled with a soupy stew, cooked for days and lush with broken-down cow’s foot, that threatens to gush at first bite.

Not much about the dining room sets Olmsted apart from any number of other new places to eat. But the quail coop and crayfish tub in the backyard, and the thoughtful, inventive food coming out of the tiny kitchen, tell you that hidden inside this simple and affordable neighborhood restaurant is another, more unusual one waiting to get out.
By PETE WELLS
Agern feels like a quiet harbor away from the eddies and currents of Grand Central Terminal. In the modern Scandinavian dining room, pale wood, charcoal seat cushions and wall tiles in mossy Grand Central green create a calming mood. Buying food raised around New York, Agern treats the city as another Scandinavian capital: Oslo-on-Hudson.

Dawa Bhuti, a young immigrant of Tibetan descent, cooks alongside her father, Ngodup Gyaltsen. The front side of the menu, devoted to brunch dishes of almost Californian lightness, is hers; the thrill is the hidden tracks, listed on the back as “ethnic plates” — Mr. Gyaltsen’s contribution from the hometown he had to leave behind.
By LIGAYA MISHAN
The menu flits from pizza to pasta to the inevitable small plates to a rib-eye for two; most of the food is cooked in wood-burning ovens; and the noteworthy wine list roams beyond Italy and offers bottles that used to be considered too good for a pizza parlor.
